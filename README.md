# twiliobasicapp

!!! Important !!!

This example is pretty raw. I am just learning React.

Intro

This is a brief example of Twilio Video based on Twilio quickstart. Using React.
I appreciate any comments on the code.
Thanks.

Concept

The Twilio quickstart example is about m2m video chats. This one is aimed at 1 to 1.

Details

The app consists of 2 parts:
- React Web app
- Flask based backend

You can use any backend you wish as long as it returns the required data.
